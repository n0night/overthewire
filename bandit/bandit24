as script is already running on the /var/spool/bandit24/, so we write a script
   script:: 
	#!/bin/bash
	cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/flag/pass
   change the mod of this file to read only i.e 666

Make a pass file using touch in directory, /tmp/flag/
   change the mod to all i.e 777

Copy the script to the /var/spool/bandit24/ and wait for a min to get the pass
